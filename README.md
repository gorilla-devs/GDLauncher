GDLauncher is a custom open source Minecraft launcher written from the ground up in C# WPF. It's main goal is to make it easy and enjoyable to manage different Minecraft versions and servers, bringing the playing and modding experience to the next level!

## Getting Started

Below you will find anything you need to know about the launcher. If you want to download a stable release you can do it from our official website: https://gorilladevs.com, if you want the latest testing features you can clone the repo and compile it yourself.

### Features

Here is what we can offer right now
* You don't need Java installed. We will download the best version for you.
* The launcher has a console where you can see all the logs of the game, so if something bad happens to the game while you are playing with some mods, you will know how to fix it!
* It's as easy as pie to install either the vanilla game and to install forge. No further action from the user is required.
* It goes without saying that it has a built-in autoupdater, so you will never need to download a new version manually.
* Premium login is not compulsory to play (offline mode will be used). You may link your mojang account later from the settings to play premium. !!IMPORTANT!! Keep in mind that by using the launcher you agree our [terms](https://gorilladevs.com/terms)
* Since this launcher was developed with an easy user experience in mind, we sticked to material design guidelines as our UI. We would like to thank ButcherBoy for his help and his availability : https://github.com/ButchersBoy/MaterialDesignInXamlToolkit

### Upcoming Features

We offer a lot of features right now, but we always want to improve. Here are some features that will be added in the future. If you have any advice or idea, just let us know or add it yourself and then share your code :)
* Ability to create, share and automatically download modpacks
* Built-in manager for Minecraft servers. You will be able to create and manage one directly from the launcher, change settings, ban users, give items...
* Cloud sync of game saves. With this you will never lose your saves again!
* A lot of other things we don't want to spoiler yet :)
