            content would tend to damage our reputation and goodwill. If we
            delete your account for the foregoing reasons, you may not

        <div>
          <p>
            We do not own any data, information or material (collectively,
            “Content”) that you submit on the Services in the course of using
            the Service. You shall have sole responsibility for the accuracy,
            quality, integrity, legality, reliability, appropriateness, and
            intellectual property ownership or right to use of all submitted
            Content. We may, but have no obligation to, monitor and review the
            Content on the Services submitted or created using our Services by
            you. You grant us permission to access, copy, distribute, store,
            transmit, reformat, display and perform the Content of your user
            account solely as required for the purpose of providing the Services
            to you. Without limiting any of those representations or warranties,
            we have the right, though not the obligation, to, in our own sole
            discretion, refuse or remove any Content that, in our reasonable
            opinion, violates any of our policies or is in any way harmful or
            objectionable. You also grant us the license to use, reproduce,
            adapt, modify, publish or distribute the Content created by you or
            stored in your user account for commercial, marketing or any similar
            purpose.

        <h2>Billing and payments</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            You shall pay all fees or charges to your account in accordance with
            the fees, charges, and billing terms in effect at the time a fee or
            charge is due and payable. Where Services are offered on a free
            trial basis, payment may be required after the free trial period
            ends, and not when you enter your billing details (which may be
            required prior to the commencement of the free trial period). If
            auto-renewal is enabled for the Services you have subscribed for,
            you will be charged automatically in accordance with the term you
            selected. If, in our judgment, your purchase constitutes a high-risk
            transaction, we will require you to provide us with a copy of your
            valid government-issued photo identification, and possibly a copy of
            a recent bank statement for the credit or debit card used for the
            purchase. We reserve the right to change products and product
            pricing at any time. We also reserve the right to refuse any order
            you place with us. We may, in our sole discretion, limit or cancel
            quantities purchased per person, per household or per order. These
            restrictions may include orders placed by or under the same customer
            account, the same credit card, and/or orders that use the same
            billing and/or shipping address. In the event that we make a change
            to or cancel an order, we may attempt to notify you by contacting
            the e-mail and/or billing address/phone number provided at the time
            the order was made.

            We reserve the right to correct any errors, inaccuracies or
            omissions, and to change or update information or cancel orders if
            any information on the Services or Services is inaccurate at any
            time without prior notice (including after you have submitted your
            order). We undertake no obligation to update, amend or clarify
            information on the Services including, without limitation, pricing
            information, except as required by law. No specified update or

            certain circumstances, with absolutely no obligation, we may be able
            to restore some or all of your data that has been deleted as of a
            certain date and time when we may have backed up data for our own
            purposes. We make no guarantee that the data you need will be
            available.

          <p>
            Although the Services may link to other resources (such as websites,
            Applications, etc.), we are not, directly or indirectly, implying
            any approval, association, sponsorship, endorsement, or affiliation
            with any linked resource, unless specifically stated herein. Some of
            the links on the Services may be “affiliate links”. This means if
            you click on the link and purchase an item, the Operator will
            receive an affiliate commission. We are not responsible for
            examining or evaluating, and we do not warrant the offerings of, any
            businesses or individuals or the content of their resources. We do

          <p>
            To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will
            the Operator, its affiliates, directors, officers, employees,
            agents, suppliers or licensors be liable to any person for any
            indirect, incidental, special, punitive, cover or consequential
            damages (including, without limitation, damages for lost profits,
            revenue, sales, goodwill, use of content, impact on business,
            business interruption, loss of anticipated savings, loss of business
            opportunity) however caused, under any theory of liability,
            including, without limitation, contract, tort, warranty, breach of
            statutory duty, negligence or otherwise, even if the liable party
            has been advised as to the possibility of such damages or could have
            foreseen such damages. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable
            law, the aggregate liability of the Operator and its affiliates,
            officers, employees, agents, suppliers and licensors relating to the
            services will be limited to an amount greater of one dollar or any
            amounts actually paid in cash by you to the Operator for the prior
            one month period prior to the first event or occurrence giving rise
            to such liability. The limitations and exclusions also apply if this
            remedy does not fully compensate you for any losses or fails of its
            essential purpose.

            harmless from and against any liabilities, losses, damages or costs,

            exercised and shall be applicable and binding only to the extent
            that they do not violate any applicable laws and are intended to be
            limited to the extent necessary so that they will not render this
