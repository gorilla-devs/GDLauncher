            any of their related products and services (collectively,
            “Services”), and our practices for collecting, using, maintaining,

            This Policy is a legally binding agreement between you (“User”,
            “you” or “your”) and this Website operator and Application developer
            (“Operator”, “we”, “us” or “our”). If you are entering into this

        <h2>Automatic collection of information</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            When you open the Website or use the Application, our servers
            automatically record information that your browser or device sends.
            This data may include information such as your device’s IP address
            and location, browser and device name and version, operating system
            type and version, language preferences, the webpage you were
            visiting before you came to the Services, pages of the Services that
            you visit, the time spent on those pages, the information you search
            for on the Services, access times and dates, and other statistics.
          </p>
          <p>
            Information collected automatically is used only to identify
            potential cases of abuse and establish statistical information
            regarding the usage and traffic of the Services. This statistical
            information is not otherwise aggregated in such a way that would
            identify any particular User of the system.
          </p>

        <h2>Collection of personal information</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            You can access and use the Services without telling us who you are
            or revealing any information by which someone could identify you as
            a specific, identifiable individual. If, however, you wish to use
            some of the features offered on the Services, you may be asked to
            provide certain Personal Information (for example, your name and
            e-mail address).
          </p>
          <p>
            We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us
            when you create an account, publish content, make a purchase, or
            fill any online forms on the Services. When required, this
            information may include the following:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Account details (such as user name, unique user ID, password, etc)
            </li>
            <li>
              Contact information (such as email address, phone number, etc)
            </li>
            <li>
              Any other materials you willingly submit to us (such as articles,
              images, feedback, etc)
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Some of the information we collect is directly from you via the
            Services. However, we may also collect Personal Information about
            you from other sources such as public databases, social media
            platforms, third-party data providers, and our joint marketing
            partners. Personal Information we collect from other sources may
            include demographic information, such as age and gender, device
            information, such as IP addresses, location, such as city and state,
            and online behavioral data, such as information about your use of
            social media websites, page view information and search results and
            links.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can choose not to provide us with your Personal Information, but
            then you may not be able to take advantage of some of the features
            on the Services. Users who are uncertain about what information is
            mandatory are welcome to contact us.

        <h2>Privacy of children</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            We do not knowingly collect any Personal Information from children
            under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, please do not
            submit any Personal Information through the Services. If you have
            reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided
            Personal Information to us through the Services, please contact us
            to request that we delete that child’s Personal Information from our
            Services.
          </p>
          <p>
            We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s
            Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing their
            children never to provide Personal Information through the Services
            without their permission. We also ask that all parents and legal
            guardians overseeing the care of children take the necessary
            precautions to ensure that their children are instructed to never
            give out Personal Information when online without their permission.

        <h2>Use and processing of collected information</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            We act as a data controller and a data processor in terms of the
            GDPR when handling Personal Information, unless we have entered into
            a data processing agreement with you in which case you would be the
            data controller and we would be the data processor.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our role may also differ depending on the specific situation
            involving Personal Information. We act in the capacity of a data
            controller when we ask you to submit your Personal Information that
            is necessary to ensure your access and use of the Services. In such
            instances, we are a data controller because we determine the
            purposes and means of the processing of Personal Information and we
            comply with data controllers’ obligations set forth in the GDPR.
          </p>
          <p>
            We act in the capacity of a data processor in situations when you
            submit Personal Information through the Services. We do not own,
            control, or make decisions about the submitted Personal Information,
            and such Personal Information is processed only in accordance with
            your instructions. In such instances, the User providing Personal
            Information acts as a data controller in terms of the GDPR.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to make the Services available to you, or to meet a legal
            obligation, we may need to collect and use certain Personal
            Information. If you do not provide the information that we request,
            we may not be able to provide you with the requested products or
            services. Any of the information we collect from you may be used for
            the following purposes:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Create and manage user accounts</li>
            <li>Deliver products or services</li>
            <li>Improve products and services</li>
            <li>Send product and service updates</li>
            <li>Respond to inquiries and offer support</li>
            <li>Request user feedback</li>
            <li>Improve user experience</li>
            <li>Protect from abuse and malicious users</li>
            <li>Run and operate the Services</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Processing your Personal Information depends on how you interact
            with the Services, where you are located in the world and if one of
            the following applies: (i) you have given your consent for one or
            more specific purposes; this, however, does not apply, whenever the
            processing of Personal Information is subject to California Consumer
            Privacy Act or European data protection law; (ii) provision of
            information is necessary for the performance of an agreement with
            you and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof; (iii)
            processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to
            which you are subject; (iv) processing is related to a task that is
            carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official
            authority vested in us; (v) processing is necessary for the purposes
            of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party.
          </p>
          <p>
            We rely on the following legal bases as defined in the GDPR upon
            which we collect and process your Personal Information:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>User’s consent</li>
            <li>Performance of a contract</li>
            <li>Our own legitimate interests</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Note that under some legislations we may be allowed to process
            information until you object to such processing by opting out,
            without having to rely on consent or any other of the legal bases
            above. In any case, we will be happy to clarify the specific legal
            basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the
            provision of Personal Information is a statutory or contractual
            requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.

        <h2>Payment processing</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            In case of Services requiring payment, you may need to provide your
            credit card details or other payment account information, which will
            be used solely for processing payments. We use third-party payment
            processors (“Payment Processors”) to assist us in processing your
            payment information securely.
          </p>
          <p>
            Payment Processors adhere to the latest security standards as
            managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint
            effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express and
            Discover. Sensitive and private data exchange happens over a SSL
            secured communication channel and is encrypted and protected with
            digital signatures, and the Services are also in compliance with
            strict vulnerability standards in order to create as secure of an
            environment as possible for Users. We will share payment data with
            the Payment Processors only to the extent necessary for the purposes
            of processing your payments, refunding such payments, and dealing
            with complaints and queries related to such payments and refunds.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please note that the Payment Processors may collect some Personal
            Information from you, which allows them to process your payments
            (e.g., your email address, address, credit card details, and bank
            account number) and handle all the steps in the payment process
            through their systems, including data collection and data
            processing. The Payment Processors’ use of your Personal Information
            is governed by their respective privacy policies which may or may
            not contain privacy protections as protective as this Policy. We
            suggest that you review their respective privacy policies.

        <h2>Managing information</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            You are able to delete certain Personal Information we have about
            you. The Personal Information you can delete may change as the
            Services change. When you delete Personal Information, however, we
            may maintain a copy of the unrevised Personal Information in our
            records for the duration necessary to comply with our obligations to
            our affiliates and partners, and for the purposes described below.
            If you would like to delete your Personal Information or permanently
            delete your account, you can do so by contacting us.

        <h2>Disclosure of information</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            Depending on the requested Services or as necessary to complete any
            transaction or provide any Service you have requested, we may share
            your information with our affiliates, contracted companies, and
            service providers (collectively, “Service Providers”) we rely upon
            to assist in the operation of the Services available to you and
            whose privacy policies are consistent with ours or who agree to
            abide by our policies with respect to Personal Information. We will
            not share any personally identifiable information with third parties
            and will not share any information with unaffiliated third parties.
          </p>
          <p>
            Service Providers are not authorized to use or disclose your
            information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or
            comply with legal requirements. Service Providers are given the
            information they need only in order to perform their designated
            functions, and we do not authorize them to use or disclose any of
            the provided information for their own marketing or other purposes.

        <h2>Retention of information</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            We will retain and use your Personal Information for the period
            necessary to comply with our legal obligations, as long as your user
            account remains active, to enforce our agreements, resolve disputes,
            and unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by
            law.
          </p>
          <p>
            We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your
            Personal Information after you update or delete it, but not in a
            manner that would identify you personally. Once the retention period
            expires, Personal Information shall be deleted. Therefore, the right
            to access, the right to erasure, the right to rectification, and the
            right to data portability cannot be enforced after the expiration of
            the retention period.

        <h2>Transfer of information</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            Depending on your location, data transfers may involve transferring
            and storing your information in a country other than your own. The
            transfer of your Personal Information to countries outside the
            European Union will be made only if you have explicitly consented to
            it or in the cases provided for by the GDPR and will be processed in
            your interest.
          </p>
          <p>
            You are entitled to learn about the legal basis of information
            transfers to a country outside the European Union or to any
            international organization governed by public international law or
            set up by two or more countries, such as the UN, and about the
            security measures taken by us to safeguard your information. If any
            such transfer takes place, you can find out more by checking the
            relevant sections of this Policy or inquire with us using the
            information provided in the contact section.

        <h2>Data protection rights under the GDPR</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (“EEA”), you
            have certain data protection rights and we aim to take reasonable
            steps to allow you to correct, amend, delete, or limit the use of
            your Personal Information. If you wish to be informed what Personal
            Information we hold about you and if you want it to be removed from
            our systems, please contact us. In certain circumstances, you have
            the following data protection rights:
          </p>
          <p>
            (i) You have the right to withdraw consent where you have previously
            given your consent to the processing of your Personal Information.
            To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your
            Personal Information is consent, you have the right to withdraw that
            consent at any time. Withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of
            processing before the withdrawal.
          </p>
          <p>
            (ii) You have the right to learn if your Personal Information is
            being processed by us, obtain disclosure regarding certain aspects
            of the processing, and obtain a copy of your Personal Information
            undergoing processing.
          </p>
          <p>
            (iii) You have the right to verify the accuracy of your information
            and ask for it to be updated or corrected. You also have the right
            to request us to complete the Personal Information you believe is
            incomplete.
          </p>
          <p>
            (iv) You have the right to object to the processing of your
            information if the processing is carried out on a legal basis other
            than consent. Where Personal Information is processed for the public
            interest, in the exercise of an official authority vested in us, or
            for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us, you may
            object to such processing by providing a ground related to your
            particular situation to justify the objection. You must know that,
            however, should your Personal Information be processed for direct
            marketing purposes, you can object to that processing at any time
            without providing any justification. To learn whether we are
            processing Personal Information for direct marketing purposes, you
            may refer to the relevant sections of this Policy.
          </p>
          <p>
            (v) You have the right, under certain circumstances, to restrict the
            processing of your Personal Information. These circumstances
            include: the accuracy of your Personal Information is contested by
            you and we must verify its accuracy; the processing is unlawful, but
            you oppose the erasure of your Personal Information and request the
            restriction of its use instead; we no longer need your Personal
            Information for the purposes of processing, but you require it to
            establish, exercise or defend your legal claims; you have objected
            to processing pending the verification of whether our legitimate
            grounds override your legitimate grounds. Where processing has been
            restricted, such Personal Information will be marked accordingly
            and, with the exception of storage, will be processed only with your
            consent or for the establishment, to exercise or defense of legal

            (vi) You have the right, under certain circumstances, to obtain the
            erasure of your Personal Information from us. These circumstances
            include: the Personal Information is no longer necessary in relation
            to the purposes for which it was collected or otherwise processed;
            you withdraw consent to consent-based processing; you object to the
            processing under certain rules of applicable data protection law;
            the processing is for direct marketing purposes; and the personal
            data have been unlawfully processed. However, there are exclusions
            of the right to erasure such as where processing is necessary: for
            exercising the right of freedom of expression and information; for
            compliance with a legal obligation; or for the establishment, to
            exercise or defense of legal claims.
          </p>
          <p>
            (vii) You have the right to receive your Personal Information that
            you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used, and
            machine-readable format and, if technically feasible, to have it
            transmitted to another controller without any hindrance from us,
            provided that such transmission does not adversely affect the rights
            and freedoms of others.
          </p>
          <p>
            (viii) You have the right to complain to a data protection authority
            about our collection and use of your Personal Information. If you
            are not satisfied with the outcome of your complaint directly with
            us, you have the right to lodge a complaint with your local data
            protection authority. For more information, please contact your
            local data protection authority in the EEA. This provision is
            applicable provided that your Personal Information is processed by
            automated means and that the processing is based on your consent, on
            a contract which you are part of, or on pre-contractual obligations
            thereof.

        <h2>California privacy rights</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            Consumers residing in California are afforded certain additional
            rights with respect to their Personal Information under the
            California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”). If you are a California
            resident, this section applies to you.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to the rights as explained in this Policy, California
            residents who provide Personal Information as defined in the statute
            to obtain Services for personal, family, or household use are
            entitled to request and obtain from us, once a calendar year,
            information about the categories and specific pieces of Personal
            Information we have collected and disclosed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, California residents have the right to request deletion
            of their Personal Information or opt-out of the sale of their
            Personal Information which may include selling, disclosing, or
            transferring Personal Information to another business or a third
            party for monetary or other valuable consideration. To do so, simply
            contact us. We will not discriminate against you if you exercise
            your rights under the CCPA.

        <h2>How to exercise your rights</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            Any requests to exercise your rights can be directed to us through
            the contact details provided in this document. Please note that we
            may ask you to verify your identity before responding to such
            requests. Your request must provide sufficient information that
            allows us to verify that you are the person you are claiming to be
            or that you are the authorized representative of such person. If we
            receive your request from an authorized representative, we may
            request evidence that you have provided such an authorized
            representative with power of attorney or that the authorized
            representative otherwise has valid written authority to submit
            requests on your behalf.
          </p>
          <p>
            You must include sufficient details to allow us to properly
            understand the request and respond to it. We cannot respond to your
            request or provide you with Personal Information unless we first
            verify your identity or authority to make such a request and confirm
            that the Personal Information relates to you.

        <h2>Data analytics</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            Our Services may use third-party analytics tools that use cookies,
            web beacons, or other similar information-gathering technologies to
            collect standard internet activity and usage information. The
            information gathered is used to compile statistical reports on User
            activity such as how often Users visit our Services, what pages they
            visit and for how long, etc. We use the information obtained from
            these analytics tools to monitor the performance and improve our
            Services.

        <h2>Do Not Track signals</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            Some browsers incorporate a Do Not Track feature that signals to
            websites you visit that you do not want to have your online activity
            tracked. Tracking is not the same as using or collecting information
            in connection with a website. For these purposes, tracking refers to
            collecting personally identifiable information from consumers who
            use or visit a website or online service as they move across
            different websites over time. How browsers communicate the Do Not
            Track signal is not yet uniform. As a result, the Services are not
            yet set up to interpret or respond to Do Not Track signals
            communicated by your browser. Even so, as described in more detail
            throughout this Policy, we limit our use and collection of your
            Personal Information.

            advertisers collect through your use of the Services. We do not
            share personally identifiable information about individual customers
            with advertisers. In some instances, we may use this aggregated and
            non-identifying information to deliver tailored advertisements to
            the intended audience.

            address, what page you are visiting on our Services, and may set a
            cookie to enable Social Media Features to function properly. Social
            Media Features are hosted either by their respective providers or
            directly on our Services. Your interactions with these Social Media

            address confidential and will not disclose your email address to any
            third parties except as allowed in the information use and
            processing section or for the purposes of utilizing a third-party
            provider to send such emails. We will maintain the information sent
            via e-mail in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.
          </p>

            newsletter or marketing emails by following the unsubscribe
            instructions included in these emails or by contacting us. However,
            you will continue to receive essential transactional emails.

            related or additional products and services. If you click on an

            The Services contain links to other resources that are not owned or
            controlled by us. Please be aware that we are not responsible for
            the privacy practices of such other resources or third parties. We
            encourage you to be aware when you leave the Services and to read

        <h2>Information security</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            We secure information you provide on computer servers in a
            controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access,
            use, or disclosure. We maintain reasonable administrative,
            technical, and physical safeguards in an effort to protect against
            unauthorized access, use, modification, and disclosure of Personal
            Information in our control and custody. However, no data
            transmission over the Internet or wireless network can be
            guaranteed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore, while we strive to protect your Personal Information, you
            acknowledge that (i) there are security and privacy limitations of
            the Internet which are beyond our control; (ii) the security,
            integrity, and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged
            between you and the Services cannot be guaranteed; and (iii) any
            such information and data may be viewed or tampered with in transit
            by a third party, despite best efforts.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the security of Personal Information depends in part on the
            security of the device you use to communicate with us and the
            security you use to protect your credentials, please take
            appropriate measures to protect this information.

            to unrelated third parties as a result of external activity,
            including, but not limited to, security attacks or fraud, we reserve
            the right to take reasonably appropriate measures, including, but
            not limited to, investigation and reporting, as well as notification
            to and cooperation with law enforcement authorities. In the event of
            a data breach, we will make reasonable efforts to notify affected
            individuals if we believe that there is a reasonable risk of harm to
            the User as a result of the breach or if notice is otherwise
            required by law. When we do, we will send you an email.
